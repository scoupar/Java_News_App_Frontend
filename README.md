# CC News

A full-stack React / Java News app.

Created with a react front-end which is connected to a spring boot Java back-end. The app features a reader-focused front section where news articles can be viewed and filtered by category and journalist. A keyword search function is also used to filter articles by their headline.

The site also features an admin section which allows the user to add, edit and delete the articles and journalist information that is displayed in the front end.

Additional features include a fully working weather widget and 'breaking news' section that pulls real news stories from the News API which updates on a regular basis.

Built with Tina Houston (https://github.com/tinaHouston/) , Helen Aguda (https://github.com/mz-biddy01/) and Gregor Simpson (https://github.com/Gregor69)
